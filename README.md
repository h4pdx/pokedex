# pokedex
i use this as kind of a functional playground for the concepts i learn in my programming class, of which i am currently taking my third, so this is some basic stuff here

i based this off of the 3DS Pokemon Moon game, and the structure of the pokedex, as well as the info already in the .txt file
this could use better documentations and commenting overall
